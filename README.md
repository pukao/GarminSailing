This app is as simple as it can get. It greets you with just the current time till a good GPS signals is acquired. Then the recording starts and the screen displays the current speed (kts), maximum speed (kts), traveled distance (nm) and elapsed time.
The bottom of the screen is used for the lap details.

After the regatta timer reaches zero a new lap starts and the bottom part shows now the time and top speed reached in the current lap.

To start the regatta timer just press the start button or on touch devices just tap the display. It then starts a 5 minute countdown, which can be modified by the usual navigation buttons.

To get the attention it beeps and vibrates at 60 seconds, 30 seconds and every second for the last 10.

Due to the simplicity it only offers minimal user interaction and saves the recording when the app is closed. The connected phone should take care of uploading to the connect platform, where the activity will be categorised as sailing.

Supported settings via the ConnectIQ app on your phone are:
- Regatta mode - default off - Do not show the current speed
- Show Lap time - default on
- Show Heading - default off - experimental
